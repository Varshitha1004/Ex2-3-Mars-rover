# Mars Rover Simulation

Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Mars Rover simulation. The Rover navigates a grid-based terrain, avoiding obstacles and executing commands to move forward, turn left, or turn right.

Features

- Grid-based terrain:The Rover operates on a 2D grid with specified dimensions.
- Obstacle avoidance: The Rover can detect and avoid obstacles placed on the grid.
- Command execution: The Rover accepts commands to move forward, turn left, or turn right.
- Status reporting:The Rover provides a status report with its current position and direction
Code Structure

- marsrover.py: Contains the main simulation logic, including the Rover and Grid classes.
- (Optional) Additional files for specific components or utility functions.

Enhancements

- Visualization: Consider using a library like Turtle Graphics or Matplotlib to visualize the Rover's movements and the grid.
- Error handling: Implement error handling for invalid commands or out-of-bounds positions.
- Advanced commands: Add more complex commands like moving a specific distance or turning a certain angle.
- Obstacle avoidance algorithm: Explore different algorithms for obstacle avoidance, such as A* search or potential field methods
